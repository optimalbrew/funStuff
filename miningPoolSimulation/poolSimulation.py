"""
In a typical mining pool, miners works together to create a shared block reward. The shared reward is distributed among participants based on difficulty shares, that is, partial work proofs that “prove” a miner was working on an appropriate block.

An appropriate block pays the reward to the pool operator, who then distributes (less a fee) the rewards to the other miners.

Using OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, miners can instead look at a set of qualified historical blocks deterministically (e.g., the last N, or all blocks not older than some time T, or blocks between T1 and T2) and share their block reward with the miner behind those blocks. OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY is an enabling technology here because it is cheap to issue remittences to all of these miners. A block would be considered qualified if it also followed the same pooling rule.

To participate in such a pool, a miner has to have enough hashpower to mine at least one block to enter the pool. Then, the system can reduce the variance that a miner is exposed to, as demonstrated in the picture. Trusted mining pools can still exist to get miners up to a reasonable level of hashrate to participate in the trustless pools effectively, but these pools would be smaller and bear less risk.

This type of mining pool has no trusted operator and requires no coordination. This eliminates various types of mining pool attacks, such as block witholding.

The below code shows a simple simulation of experienced variances among a set of miners with a fixed sharing policy versus a set of miners without any sharing.
